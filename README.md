Here is the code for my final year project

The Joey folder is for T2G model, it contains the best model discussed in the Paper however no data due to size, you can try to download the PHOENIX14T dataset online here: https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/

The other fold is a fixed up version of Ben Saunders Progressive Transformer, it acts in the same described in his readme so I left it in. Although for this the models were too big even for LFS and especially the data so I wasn't able to upload them at least on the free version of github. Also worth mentioning the code isn't cleaned up very much, it's intened for research and so you'll see lots of prints commented out and such but it should still run following the right requirements installed.
